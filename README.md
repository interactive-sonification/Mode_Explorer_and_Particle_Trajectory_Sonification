# Mode Explorer and Particle Trajectory Sonification Example Notebook

* Install Python2.7, recommend using Anaconda

* Install pyaudio, recommend conda install pyaudio, which will install portaduio c library

* pip install -r requirements.txt

* cd pyo --> python setup.py install  
	This is a cutomized pyo library with FIFOPlayer


For core of method is in the Cython cell. 


## Important Notice

Please note that this project has been discontinued and not maintained. Since the world has moved on from Python 2.7, I currently have no plan to reactivate the project and make it works as it was originally intended. The current repo is only served as a method reference for the papers published in:

J. Yang and T. Hermann, “Interactive Mode Explorer Sonification Enhances Exploratory Cluster Analysis”, JAES, Volume 66, Issue 9, 703-711, 2018.
